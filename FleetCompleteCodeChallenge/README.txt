This file contains the entire intelliJ project I used for this challenge.

The Submission folder contains the program jar file as well as the dictionary that I used to test. 

Please note that my implementation assumes that the dictionary file only contains ascii characters. 

The java code and test file can be found in the src/com/matt directory.

Please use Java 8 to run the program.

To run the program please do the following.

	1) Navigate to the Submission folder in the terminal

	2) Place the dictionary file you wish to use inside the Submission folder

	3) run the jar file with arguments formatted as. 

	java -jar FleetCompleteCodeChallenge.jar <Master Word> <Dictionary File Name>

	For example, using the dictionary I have included and the master word "listen"

	java -jar FleetCompleteCodeChallenge.jar listen words
